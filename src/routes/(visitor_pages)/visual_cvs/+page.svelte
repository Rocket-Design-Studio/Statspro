			<h3>Statspro Visual CVs</h3>
			<p>
				A Player's Visual CV is his first opportunity to impress his agent, scout or coach and the
				impact of this opportunity cannot be overstated. It is thus important for your Visual CV to
				make an immediate impact. With more than 15 years in the industry, we know what agents and
				coaches are looking for in each position, and we adjust each CV to meet those needs.
			</p>

		<div class="process">
			<h3>The process</h3>
			<p>When we are approached to build a visual CV for a player, we will send him a price list with various options as well as our internal rules when making a CV.</p>
			<p>As soon as the player or his parents gives us the go-ahead, we create a WhatsApp group with our head of Visual CVs, the parent and sometimes the player. Here we ask for 4 action photos, the player’s height and weight and a list of teams that he has represented. </p>
			<p>We then proceed to create the CV and as soon as we are happy with it, we send you the invoice. As soon as we have received the payment, we send you a download link as well as a link to watch the CV on your phone.</p>
			<p>The average turnaround time is two weeks, depending on how many other CVs we have to complete before we start on yours.</p>

			<h3>Our Player Profile </h3>
			<p>The days when agents and scouts gave out contracts purely based on a good highlights package of the player is long gone. We try to show the player in a good light while also providing the agent and scout with training and testing data. </p>
			<p>We have recently launched our player profile that has a built in ranking system.</p>

			<div class="player_profile_image">
				<h4>Here is an example of such a Profile.</h4>
				<img src="images/player_profile.png" alt="">
			</div>

			<p>The ranking system provides the player with feedback on how his stats compare with other players in his position and age group or league based on a weighted algorithm. This gives an agent a clear picture of the player’s abilities. </p>
